 * A cube, or perfect box, is a three dimensional shape composed of six faces that are perpendicular to each other. Each face is composed of four vertices that are connected by edges that are perpendicular to each other. The total number of vertices in the box is eight with each vertex being shared by three edges and three sides. The distance from the center of the cube to each vertex is constant. The length of any side of the box is constant.
